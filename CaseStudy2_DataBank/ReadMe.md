# Case Study 2: Data Bank Analysis  

**Skills Demonstrated**
- **Advanced SQL:** CTEs, Aggregations, Joins, Analytical Functions
- **Data Analysis:** Customer Transactions, Network Nodes
- **Business Insights:** Regional Distribution, Transaction Trends

## Overview  
This project dives into the operations of **Data Bank**, a Neo-Bank linking customer account balances with cloud storage allocations. Using SQL, I analyzed the bankâ€™s network structure, customer transactions, and node transitions to derive actionable insights for business optimization.

## Project Details  

### Business Problem  
**Data Bank** aimed to:  
- Understand its network structure at regional and node levels.  
- Analyze customer behavior based on transaction types and amounts.  
- Calculate customer transition times between nodes.  
- Explore deposit patterns and multi-transaction activity.

## Operations Performed  
---
### **Data Exploration**


#### 1.	How many different nodes make up the Data Bank network?

SQL Code: 
```sql
select count(distinct node_id) as unique_nodes
from customer_nodes;
```

**Output:**
- Total number of unique nodes in the Data Bank network.

#### 2.	How many nodes are there in each region?

SQL Code: 
```sql
select region_id, count(node_id) as node_count
from customer_nodes join regions
using(region_id)
group by region_id;
```

**Output:**
- Count of nodes per region.

#### 3.	How many customers are divided among the regions?

SQL Code: 
```sql
select region_id, count(distinct customer_id) as customers
from customer_nodes join regions
using(region_id)
group by region_id;
```

**Output:**
- Number of customers per region.

#### 4.	Determine the total amount of transactions for each region name.

SQL Code: 
```sql
select region_name, sum(txn_amount) as total_transaction
from customer_transactions join customer_nodes
using(customer_id)
join regions using(region_id)
group by region_name;
```

**Output:**

- Total transaction amount for each region.

#### 5.	How long does it take on an average to move clients to a new node?

SQL Code: 
```sql
select round(avg(datediff(end_date, start_date)),2) as average_days
from customer_nodes
where end_date <> '9999-12-31';
```

**Output:**

- Average number of days customers spend on a node before transitioning.

#### 7.	What is the average number and size of past deposits across all customers?

SQL Code: 
```sql
select round(count(customer_id)/ (select count(distinct customer_id) from customer_transactions))as avg_no_of_deposits,
sum(txn_amount) / count(txn_amount) as avg_size_of_deposits
from customer_transactions
where txn_type = 'deposit';
```

**Output:**

- Average number and size of deposits across all customers.

#### 8.	For each month - how many Data Bank customers make more than 1 deposit and at least either 1 purchase or 1 withdrawal in a single month?

SQL Code: 
```sql
with cte as 
(select customer_id, month(txn_date) as txn_month, 
sum(if(txn_type = 'deposit',1,0)) as deposit_count,
sum(if(txn_type = 'withdrawal',1,0)) as withdrawal_count,
sum(if(txn_type = 'purchase',1,0)) as purchase_count
from customer_transactions
group by customer_id, month(txn_date))
select txn_month, count(distinct customer_id) as customer_count
from cte
where deposit_count > 1
and purchase_count = 1 or withdrawal_count = 1
group by txn_month;
```

**Output:**

- Number of customers performing multiple transactions in each month.
