## Overview  
This project dives into the operations of **Data Bank**, a Neo-Bank that ties customer account balances to cloud storage. Using SQL, I analyzed network structure, transaction behaviors, and customer activity to help optimize business strategies.  

## Key Highlights  
1. **Unique Nodes**: Counted distinct nodes in the Data Bank network.  
2. **Regional Distribution**: Identified nodes and customers by region.  
3. **Transaction Analysis**: Summarized total transaction amounts and types.  
4. **Customer Behavior**: Examined deposit trends and multi-transaction activity.  
5. **Transition Time**: Calculated average customer movement time between nodes.  

## Schema  
### Tables Used:  
- **regions**: Contains region details.  
- **customer_nodes**: Tracks customer-node relationships and time periods.  
- **customer_transactions**: Stores transaction details (type, amount, date).
